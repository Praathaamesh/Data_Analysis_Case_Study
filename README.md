#Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
#### **Overview**
Welcome to the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project! In this project, we will explore and analyze a real-world dataset to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. The primary goal of this capstone project is to showcase the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

#### **Project Description**
The capstone project revolves around trend analysis of a fitness tracker survey. Our objective is to answer specific business questions, discover patterns, and provide actionable recommendations based on our analysis.

#### **Requirements**
To run the project notebook, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook/VSCode
Required Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Daily Activity Dataset
The dataset for this project is available in the data directory. It contains daily activity tracked by the tracker. Before running the notebook, ensure you have the dataset file (daily_activity_merged.csv) in the appropriate location.

#### **Getting Started**
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up the required environment with Python and necessary libraries.
Place the dataset file in the data directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook/VSCode (Case_Study_GDA.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab or VSCode.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code and see the results.
